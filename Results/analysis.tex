\section[Analysis of Data]{Our Analysis of the received E-Mail Data}
During our analysis of the received e-mails, we found that the e-mails that we received belonged to one of three broad categories:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item E-Mails with the `bcc' header successfully injected\\
	This form of injection was our initial objective and we found 180 such e-mails in our received e-mails. This indicates that the websites that sent out these e-mails are vulnerable to e-mail header injection, where we could inject and manipulate any header.
	
	\item E-Mails with the `to' header successfully injected
	\item E-Mails with the `x-check' header successfully injected
\end{enumerate}
