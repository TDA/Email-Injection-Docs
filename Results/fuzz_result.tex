\section{Fuzzed data}
We performed our fuzzing attempts on the gathered data with both the regular payload and malicious payload and received a set of e-mails. Table~\ref{tab:fuzzed_data} shows the quantity of e-mails that we received for each payload. We explain in detail what each piece of data shown in the table represents, in the following section.

\paragraph{E-Mail received from Forms}
The e-mails that we received can be broadly categorized into two categories:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item E-Mails due to regular payload\\
	This represents the total number of websites that sent back e-mails to us. This indicates that we were able to successfully submit the forms on these sites, without any bot-prevention etc.
	\item E-Mails due to malicious payload\\
    Once we receive an e-mail from a website due to the regular payload, we go back and fuzz those forms with more malicious payloads. This field, in essence, represents the total number of websites that are vulnerable to e-mail header injection.
\end{enumerate}
The following section showcases the different categories of e-mails we received and presents our analysis on these e-mails.
