\section{Potential Impact}

The impact of the vulnerability can be pretty far-reaching.
Table \ref{tab:usage} shows the current Server side language usage statistics on the Web, compiled from \cite{W3techs}. 
PHP, Java, Python and Ruby (combined) account for over 85\%\footnote{Note: a website may use more than one server-side programming language} of the websites in existence. The vulnerability can be exploited to do potentially any of the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Phishing and Spoofing Attacks
	\item Denial of service by attacking the underlying mail server
	\item Spam Networks
\end{itemize}

It is evident that if proper validation for E-Mail is not performed by these sites, this can quickly escalate to a huge issue.
