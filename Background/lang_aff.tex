\section{Languages Affected}

This section describes the popular languages which exhibit this type of vulnerability. 
\begin{itemize}
	\item PHP was one of the first languages found to have this vulnerability in its implementation of the \emph{mail()} function. The early finding of this vulnerability can be attributed in part to the success and popularity of the language for creating web pages. According to \cite{W3techs}, PHP is used by 81.7\% of all the websites in existence, thereby creating the possibility of this vulnerability to be widespread. 
	
	PHP's low barrier to entry, and lack of developer education about the existence of this vulnerability have contributed to the vulnerability continuing to exist in the language.
	It is to be noted that after 13 further iterations of the language since the 4.0 release (the current version is 7.1), the \emph{mail()} function is yet to be fixed.
	
	\item Python - A bug was filed about the vulnerability in Python's implementation of the \emph{email} library and its header parsing functions in 2009, which was followed up with a patch in early 2011
	\item Java - Describe which functions/params are affected
	\item Ruby - Has this as %well.Net::SMTP.start('localhost', 1025) do |smtp|
	%smtp.send_message message, 'me@fromdomain.com',
	%'test@todomain.com'

\end{itemize}
