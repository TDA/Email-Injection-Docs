\section{History of E-Mail Injection}

E-Mail Header Injection seems to have been first documented over a decade ago, in a late 2004 Article on phpsecure.info (\cite{Tobozo}) accredited to user tobozo@phpsecure.info describing how this vulnerability existed on the reference implementation of the mail function in PHP, and how it can be exploited. More recently, a blog post by Damon Kohler (\cite{DK}) and an accompanying wiki article (\cite{Injection}) describe the attack vector, and outline a few defense measures for the same.

Since this vulnerability was initially found in the \emph{mail()} function of PHP, E-Mail Header Injection can be traced to as early as early 2000's, present in the \emph{mail()} implementation of PHP 4.0. It is to be noted that after 13 further iterations of the language (the current version is 7.1), the \emph{mail()} function is yet to be fixed.

The vulnerability was also described very briefly (less than a page) by Stuttard and Pinto in their widely acclaimed book, ``\emph{The Web Application Hacker's Handbook: Discovering and Exploiting Security Flaw}'' (\cite{stuttard2011web}). 
A concise timeline of the vulnerability is presented in Table \ref{tab:history}.
