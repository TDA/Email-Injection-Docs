\section{Proof of Concept Attacks}
The previous section (Section. \ref{Arch:Test}) discussed in detail how we verified that our system functions according to our expectations. This section details how we validated our expectations. In order to do this, we constructed 3 sets of web applications in PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these applications was a simple web app that took in user input to construct and send an E-Mail.

The front-end for each of the three applications is shown in Listing. \ref{code:html}.
