\section{Proof of Concept Attacks}
The previous section (Section. \ref{Arch:Test}) discussed in detail how we verified that our system functions according to our expectations. This section details how we validated our expectations. In order to do this, we constructed 3 sets of web applications in PHP, Python, and Ruby. Each of these applications was a simple web app that took in user input to construct and send an E-Mail.

The front-end for each of the three applications is shown in Listing. \ref{code:html}. The back-end for the three languages are shown in Listings \ref{code:phpemi}, \ref{code:pyemi}, and \ref{code:rubyemi}.

We tested for the headers being injected in real-time by running an instance of MailCatcher, set to listen on all SMTP messages. A sample screenshot of a fuzzed request for the Ruby backend (generated in PostMan) is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:postmanruby}. The E-Mail sent due to injecting this payload (as captured by MailCatcher) is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:mailcatcherruby}. It can be seen that the Headers have been added to the resulting E-Mail, and we have successfully managed to overwrite the `Subject' field with our own message.\\
Both PHP and Python are injected with headers in a similar way.
